Description: The backfill Bayesian optimal interval design using efficacy and toxicity outcomes for 
    dose optimization (BF-BOIN-ET) design is a novel clinical trial design to allow patients to be 
    backfilled at lower doses during a dose-finding trial while prioritizing the dose-escalation 
    cohort to explore a higher dose. The advantages compared to the other designs in terms of the 
    percentage of correct optimal dose (OD) selection, reducing the sample size, and shortening the 
    duration of the trial, in various realistic setting.
